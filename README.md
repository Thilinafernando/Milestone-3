Philosophers is a project that introduces the basics of multithreading and synchronization in C. It uses threads to simulate philosophers eating, thinking, and sleeping at the same time, and mutexes to prevent data conflicts when they share resources like forks.

It’s all about understanding how to manage concurrent processes and avoid problems like deadlocks and race conditions.
